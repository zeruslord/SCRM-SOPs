# Scream and Panic vehicle standard operating procedures

## Universal
- Don't auto-spawn, use M to get into the map and pick your spawn from there.  If running vehicles, wait to spawn until your squad lead or driver tells you where to go

### Comms
- The nose of the vehicle is the front for calling spots and targets.  In a harasser, this is often none of the direction of motion, the direction the gunner is looking, or the direction the driver is looking.
- when running a single vehicle or working independently, use directions relative to the vehicle.  When working with a group, cardinal directions are more useful to oter vehicles.
- Comms time is a limited resource in combat, so keep things as terse as possible.  See the Callouts section for a how-to.
- When running halberd or an MBT main cannon, count your hits.  "one in" means you hit once, "two in rear" means two shots hit rear armor.  If we're rolling just one or two vehicles, you can call misses as well, but if you count your hits consistently, not calling a hit will tell the driver you missed.
- Tell people who you're up against - we don't know every decent vehicle player, but the more experienced guys know what outfit tags to be afraid of and who the top players are.
- commnicate when it's time to repair and what kind of reps to do.  "Double" means both out and repair, "Single" means driver gets out to repair, "backseat" in a harasser means the gunner siwtches to seat three to repair on the move.

### Callouts
- "On X" means X is the current target.  "On" can be added to any vehicle callout.
- if you hear a weapon sound to the left, say "hear *weapon* left"
- if you see a vehicle to the left, say  "*vehicle* left".  If it's an MBT or sunderer and you know the gun, say "*weapon* *vehicle* left".  If it's a harasser and you recognize the gun, just say "*weapon* left".
- "Sundy" or "bus" means sunderer, "Mag" or "Maggy" means magrider, "Bazzy" means basilisk.
- if a spotted vehicle is smoking, add "smoking" to the callout, before or after.  Same goes for "burning".
- if you are in the rear quadrant of a tank, add "showing ass" to the end of the callout.
- if you see smoke but no vehicle, say "smoke left".

### Loadouts
- You should be an engineer unless we're doing something funny.
- Engineers should be carrying the Archer, tank mines, mine pouch, either EOD HUD for drivers or Enhanced Targeting for gunners.  If you don't have stuff certed it's fine, but this is generally considered optimal.
- Standard harasser loadout for AV work is fire suppression, either stealth or composite armor, and racer chassis.
- Standard harasser loadout for AI work is fire suppression, either composite armor or mineguard, and scrapper.
- Battle Buses can be either proximity repair or armor, and usually carry Furies or Basilisks.  In any case, Fire Suppression and Racer chassis.  Battle Buses may occasionally use Gate Shield Defuser, but it's very situational.
- Spawn buses should be either deploy shield or max stealth.  Optimal guns would be a basilisk and a walker/ranger, but two basilisks is fine on Live.
- Vanguards are typically shield, either stealth or side armor, and either racer or rival.  AP cannons should be paired with halberd or enforcer.

## Harasser Driving
### Mechanics
- Know the special controls - spacebar for handbrake, shift for turbo
- Understand air control - w pitches forward, s pitches back, a rolls left, d rolls right.  Try to land all four wheels on the ground.
- Understand handbrake turns and powersliding.  This is really a topic for a video or a VR session, talk to zerus (or your local harasser guru) if you want some demos/explanation/practice.
- Be aware of armor facing mechanics - shots count as rear armor or side armor based on where the gunner is relative to the target, not where the shot landed.
- Understand clientside and how it applies to vehicles.  Runovers are based on what happens on the screen of the pedestrian, vehicle rams happen based on the ramming vehicle.

## Gunning
- Trust your driver.  If he makes the call to leave a fight, repair, or stay in, do what he's doing.  If you bail on your driver when he's trying to fight or run, you're both in a worse position than if you'd stayed in the vehicle.
- When rolling a mix of high-alpha weapons (MBT cannons, Lightning Python cannons, halberds) and low-alpha weapons (everything else), let the high alpha weapons take the first shot.  Don't give us away to get a couple bullets downrange.
- When getting into a battlebus, redeploy and wait for it to appear as a spawn option. It'll be faster than meeting the bus somwhere.

### Target Selection
- In a harasser, stay on your target unless there's something really juicy (like, something burning or something smoking while showing ass).  Your driver should be working to get you shots on one particular thing, and if you switch without telling him, you'll lose sight of the target you switched to.
- In an MBT, focus the target your driver is on.  Your extra DPS doesn't matter if it's not killing the same thing.
- In buses, there should be one person calling targets for all the bus gunners in the group.  It's more important that fire be focused than that it be on the biggest threat or juiciest target.  If the shot-caller says "infantry", shoot whoever.

### Spotting
- Don't q-spot until you're ready to shoot.  Spotting early can give you away - the callout is universally audible and they might be running the counter-intelligence implant.
- Do q-spot when you shoot.  Putting targets on the map makes things a lot easier on your driver - if he can see the enemy on the map, he can look where he's going with the camera.
- If a target is already spotted and unaware, try to get the name before engaging.
